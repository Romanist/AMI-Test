1. "Using the existing code, we would like to create a new layer displayed on top of the displayed image / slice and make this new layer editable using the mouse."
Is created layer common for all slices or uniq for each one? 

слой технически не может быть общим.  

2. "User clicks in a given pixel location"
What was meant by "given pixel location"? Coordiantes of single clicked pixel? All pixels with the color we picked from color picker? Is there anywhere we should take it from? 

имеются в виду координаты одного кликаемого пикселя. 

3. "At that pixel location, the color of the pixel is replaced with the color selected by the user" 
Color replacement for single pixel at new layer, right? 

палитра может быть любой. в задаче не стоит способ, как задается палитра, эта функция встроена в three. js 





Pixel-based editing using a color selected by the user

Description of the task

Using the existing code, we would like to create a new layer displayed on top of the displayed image / slice and make this new layer editable using the mouse.

By editable, we mean that:

User selects a color from a color picker
User goes to a given slice
User clicks in a given pixel location
At that pixel location, the color of the pixel is replaced with the color selected by the user

What we expect from the developer:

A high-level design (how he plan to implement the feature)
The implementation of his design
